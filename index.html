          <h3> Lake Bled, Slovenia </h3>
          <p>Visit Lake Bled to make your wishes come true
          Traditional wooden boats – pletnas – have been taking visitors to the island in the middle of the lake for centuries. These boats are operated by standing rowers known as pletnars. After landing, guests climb 99 stone steps to reach the Assumption of Mary Church. On this island, which is the subject of legendary tales, listen to the church bell and ring it yourself. Legend has it that this will make your wishes come true. As you return to the lake shore, view the island on the lake from the castle or from the walking and horse-carriage trails that lead you around the lake. Take a ride with Bled coachmen, known as fijakers!<a href= "//www.lonelyplanet.com/"> Read More </a> </p>

          <h3> Zadar, Croatia </h3>
          <p>Boasting a historic old town of Roman ruins, medieval churches, cosmopolitan cafes and quality museums set on a small peninsula, Zadar is an intriguing city. It’s not too crowded and its two unique attractions – the sound-and-light spectacle of the Sea Organ and the Sun Salutation – need to be seen and heard to be believed.
          While it’s not a picture-postcard kind of place from every angle, the mix of ancient relics, Habsburg elegance and coastal setting all offset the unsightly tower blocks climbing up the hilly hinterland. It's no Dubrovnik, but it's not a museum town either – this is a living, vibrant city, enjoyed by residents and visitors alike.<a href= "//www.lonelyplanet.com/"> Read More </a></p>

          <h3> Mostar, Bosnia & Herzogovina </h3>
          <p>At dusk, narrow Kujundžiluk ('gold alley') bustles joyously with trinket sellers. And in between, the Balkans' most celebrated bridge forms a majestic stone arc between reincarnated medieval towers. It's an enchanting scene. Do stay into the evening to see it without the summer hordes of day trippers. Indeed, stay longer to enjoy memorable attractions in the surrounding area as well as pondering the city's darker side – beyond the cobbled lanes of the attractively restored Ottoman quarter are still-apparent scars of the 1990s conflict.
          Between November and April most tourist facilities go into hibernation while midsummer can get scorchingly hot. Spring and autumn are ideal.<a href= "//www.lonelyplanet.com/"> Read More </a></p>

          <h3> Madrid, Spain </h3>
          <p> No city on earth is more alive than Madrid, a beguiling place whose sheer energy carries a simple message: this city really knows how to live. Few cities boast an artistic pedigree quite as pure as Madrid’s: many art lovers return here again and again. For centuries, Spanish royals showered praise and riches upon the finest artists of the day, from home-grown talents such as Goya and Velázquez to Flemish and Italian greats. Masterpieces by these and other Spanish painters such as Picasso, Dalí and Miró now adorn the walls of the city’s world-class galleries.<a href= "//www.lonelyplanet.com/"> Read More </a></p>
